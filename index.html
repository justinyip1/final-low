      With the internet, especially high speed broadband internet becoming more and more accessible these days, we wanted to see how the markup of a state’s population and demographics affected the household usage of internet among states. This was of interest to our group as we grew up in the internet age and while we were always exposed to it, we wanted to see if there were differences in how much internet was used throughout the country. Were states that had a wealthier population prone to using more internet? Did states that had more poverty have less average usage? These were some of the questions that we sought to answer however at the end of the day we wanted to see if some demographics were prone to more household internet usage. While this data is from 2010, the internet was still very prevalent in the country at the time and should act as a good source for our search for the truth.

      We first shifted our attention to geographic location because we felt that people in similar geographies would have similar lifestyles and internet usage patterns. Likewise, we thought that perhaps colder states would have more household internet usage over states that tended to be warmer or further south. When looking at the data mapped out over the US, we found that internet usage actually did vary by geographic region with New England and the Pacific Coast states being in the high 70’s to 80’s. The midwest was mostly in the 70’s as well. We believe those states tend to get colder and the fact that the populations are spread out, it could become isolating without the internet. It was interesting to find that the southern states had some of the lowest household internet usage. While the exact cause is unknown based on the regional cluster of low scores, it may be attributed to warmer weather letting people go out more or poorer internet structure in the region. This was seen within the map visualization with the southern states having a lighter shade of blue to them incorporating the hue aspect into the visualization. This map graph was highly effective when put into application as we were easily able to see different clusters within the country when trying to assess household internet usage as the Northeast and Pacific Northwest had high usage while the South tended to be on the lower end.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then decided to analyze the average household internet usage based on the population of the state. We found that states like California, Texas and New York, while they have large populations, were not indicative of the average household. When hovering over each bar, you could see how Texas, with a population of over 25 million meaning it is a prosperous state, had an average of 65.5. New Hampshire on the other hand had a population of 1.3 million but internet usage of 84.7. We had originally thought that states with larger populations would have more people using the internet thus have a higher household average however, this proved not to be the case meaning there are other extrinsic factors at play. A simple bar chart was enough for this as it provided the population information we needed and gave us the household data with tooltips allowing us to view the information on a state by state basis.

   After our initial findings we decided to see if wealth played a factor as it does in most aspects of our lives and decided to look at the average wage within each state. Our belief was that those with higher wages could afford more internet connected electronics and likewise would live more comfortable lives where they have time to use the internet. When looking at the data however it became clear that wage did not predict internet usage which if anything just showed how reliant we as a society are on the internet. Whether you are from a poorer state or a wealthier state, internet usage had no clear trend and tended to stay with a similar flat pattern. 
We settled on using a bar graph to show the population totals with household income being in tooltips as we felt that it would be easy for the reader to understand and interact with.

    </p>
    <p>
     Similar to wealth we decided to look on the opposite end of the spectrum and see if we could find any patterns when it came to poverty and internet usage. Our hypothesis was that those states who had a higher poverty rate would likely have less of an ability to afford or have devices to connect to the internet. In this visualization we actually were able to find a noticeable pattern with states that had higher poverty rates tended to have lower average household internet usage. Intuitively this made sense to our team as those who did not have stable housing/income or were impoverished likely had other problems to deal with rather than use the internet and likewise, did not necessarily have the money or resources to constantly be on the internet.

    With poverty yielding a noticeable trend with internet usage, we decided to then follow that up with unemployment to see whether internet usage was also affected by a lack of income. Our justification was that while those who were unemployed may not be impoverished, their financial standing in society is not necessarily up to par with others so they may have less resources to use the internet with. In turn we would see states with higher unemployment have lower household internet usage. What we found here was that when it came to unemployment there was no discernible pattern for internet usage. It was odd to see that New hampshire, the state with one of the largest household internet usages, also had the largest rate of unemployment. Similarly, the graph crealy shows that states who are on par with each other when it comes to unemployment rate can be on opposite ends of the spectrum with household internet usage as seen Massachusetts and Mississippi. If anything this shows that if people have the resources, even limited resources they will continue to go on the internet. Paring the unemployment with an area graph and the household internet usage with a line graph enabled the user to easily see that there was no trend within internet usage based on unemployment as the internet usage was highly variable with constant increases and decreases occurring in similar unemployment ranges.

    <p>
      Since unemployment did not yield any significant results we then decided to look at the age demographic within different states. In our group's view, we thought that younger adults and teens tended to use the internet more than the older generation and thus we would see higher average household usage among states that had a greater percentage of 18-21 year olds. What we found though was that there was no clear pattern among internet usage and age group as some of the states with the lowest percentage of 18-21 year olds had the highest usage. This was surprising to us as we figured younger people have their lives integrated more into the internet however, perhaps as a population and society as a whole we have all become more dependent on the internet across the board. This was also supported by the double line graph of the population 21 years or older because while that stayed fairly stable and flat, the internet usage among state still continued to spike, indicating age demographics had little to do with internet usage.When looking at this data, we decided to use a bubbles to indicate the percentage of those who were 18-21 and compare that to the dual axis line graph which showed household internet usage as we thought we would see increases in usage as the percentage of 18-21 year olds increased. While the graph was good for comparison it also served to disprove our original hypothesis and showed that young adults had little impact on internet usages per household. Also for the ages of 21 years and older we used a double line graph in comparison to internet usage which was beneficial in comparison as it showed stability among the age group by state however, internet usage would be varying considerably showing no trend among ages.

      We looked at the effect of labor-intensive jobs on internet usage, since we hypothesized that blue-collar jobs such as manufacturing, construction, and mining wouldn’t necessarily need the internet to succeed. After all, strong economic growth in the United States during the 20th century was fueled by these sectors’ output and didn’t require internet usage. However, upon closer inspection, we noticed a little correlation when it came to blue collar jobs such as construction, manufacturing, and mining jobs. Some states had spikes in certain jobs; Texas led all states in these blue collar jobs except for manufacturing, which came second to California. Analysis of mining jobs was particularly fruitless, with Texas leading by far. Even if the state was excluded, there was still little trend in regards to internet usage.

    <h2>
      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      What we found here is that most of the identifiers we thought would yield patterns in household internet usage did not actually come to fruition. Age, population and income demographics all had little to do with how much internet was being used by households. We did notice that poverty had a discernible trend in that the more impoverished a state was on average, it tended to have lower internet usage among its households. This made sense to us but, what was striking was that when looking at these impoverished and low internet usage states on a map graph, we found that many of these states were focused in the Southern part of the United states. While we did not have the data to find causation of these results it showed clear clusters of low internet usage compared to northern states especially New England and the Pacific Northwest. As a group we hypothesized that the warmer weather in the south may encourage people to spend more time outside rather than indoors on the internet. The prevalence of blue-collar jobs had little impact on the internet usage of states, which surprised us, considering we thought that there was less need for the internet in labor-heavy states. Also, perhaps the infrastructure in that region may not be as stable, considering the fact that the low internet usage is geographically clustered. Overall, as a society it is clear that our lives are firmly rooted in the internet. From those with high income to those with low income or no jobs, people are constantly on the internet. In no state was the household usage below 50 showing that the majority of people are connected to the internet and use it often. This data was taken in 2010 so it would be safe to assume that these usage numbers have only increased since then as internet infrastructure has gotten better and technology has advanced significantly since then.
