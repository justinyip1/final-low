    <h1>
      Effect of Demographics on Internet Usage in the United States
    </h1>
    <p>
      With the internet, especially high speed broadband internet becoming more and more accessible these days, we wanted to see how the markup of a state’s population and demographics affected the household usage of internet among states. This was of interest to our group as we grew up in the internet age and while we were always exposed to it, we wanted to see if there were differences in how much internet was used throughout the country. Were states that had a wealthier population prone to using more internet? Did states that had more poverty have less average usage? These were some of the questions that we sought to answer however at the end of the day we wanted to see if some demographics were prone to more household internet usage. While this data is from 2010, the internet was still very prevalent in the country at the time and should act as a good source for our search for the truth.

      We first shifted our attention to geographic location because we felt that people in similar geographies would have similar lifestyles and internet usage patterns. Likewise, we thought that perhaps colder states would have more household internet usage over states that tended to be warmer or further south. When looking at the data mapped out over the US, we found that internet usage actually did vary by geographic region with New England and the Pacific Coast states being in the high 70’s to 80’s. The midwest was mostly in the 70’s as well. We believe those states tend to get colder and the fact that the populations are spread out, it could become isolating without the internet. It was interesting to find that the southern states had some of the lowest household internet usage. While the exact cause is unknown based on the regional cluster of low scores, it may be attributed to warmer weather letting people go out more or poorer internet structure in the region. This was seen within the map visualization with the southern states having a lighter shade of blue to them incorporating the hue aspect into the visualization.

We then decided to analyze the average household internet usage based on the population of the state. We found that states like California, Texas and New York, while they have large populations, were not indicative of the average household. When hovering over each bar, you could see how Texas, with a population of over 25 million meaning it is a prosperous state, had an average of 65.5. New Hampshire on the other hand had a population of 1.3 million but internet usage of 84.7. We had originally thought that states with larger populations would have more people using the internet thus have a higher household average however, this proved not to be the case meaning there are other extrinsic factors at play.

   After our initial findings we decided to see if wealth played a factor as it does in most aspects of our lives and decided to look at the average wage within each state. Our belief was that those with higher wages could afford more internet connected electronics and likewise would live more comfortable lives where they have time to use the internet. When looking at the data however it became clear that wage did not predict internet usage which if anything just showed how reliant we as a society are on the internet. Whether you are from a poorer state or a wealthier state, internet usage had no clear trend and tended to stay with a similar flat pattern.
